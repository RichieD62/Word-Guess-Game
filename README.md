# Word-Guess-Game

This is a Word Guess Game. It is similar to hangman where the user will guess letters to try to complete a random word. If the user guesses the letters correctly within the allotted amount of guesses, he/she wins. If not, he/she loses. Users can get started  by simply opening up the application in any web browser and typing on the keyboard.

This was one of the first times that I used JavaScript so the main challenges I had were fundamental challenges like creating arrays, pushing user information into those arrays, manipulating the DOM, and creating a reset. I spent most of my time researching the fundamentals of JavaScript and once I had some grasp on the information I was able to implement what I had learned in this project.
